PARAMETER NOTES (in order, as outlined in exe.py)

#####################################################################################################
size_list: List of array sizes, written as [[Array1#OfRows, Array1#OfColumns], [Array2#OfRows, Array2#OfColumns], ...]
-[16, 16] and larger sizes are sufficient to show long-range order (LRO)

gamma: Spin dynamics parameter
-float
-Smaller gamma means slower memory dynamics, so one may have to increase T to compensate (very computationally expensive to collect statistically significant data when gamma < 10^-2)
-gamma = 1 corresponds to comparable memory and spin timescales
-gamma \in [0.01, 10] used in our study

delta: Spin dynamics parameter
-float
-delta \in (0.5, 1) required for non-trivial dynamics
-delta = 0.75 used in our study

g: Spin dynamics parameter
-float
-g > 1 for non-trivial dynamics, but should be kept of order 1 when studying the relationship between gamma and J_{I, j}, the spin and memory inverse timescales (as to not introduce an additional, distinct timescale)
-g = 2.0 used in our study

xini: Initial memory (uniform across all spins)
-float
-I've almost always kept xini = 0.5


subdirectory: Subdirectory name (where simulation data will be stored)
-string
-Directory will be created if it doesn't already exist

num_instances: Number of instances in this ensemble
-integer

check_initialization: Parameter allowing for the randomized J_{i, j} interactions and initial spin configurations to be saved as .jpg's
-boolean

spin_tracker: Parameter which checks how many spins are within [-0.5, 0.5] at each simulation timestep
-boolean
-If no spins are designated as "interesting" (i.e. \in [-0.5, 0.5]) at any timestep, the simulation is immediately stopped
-This feature is most useful in smaller (sz < [16, 16]) cases when equilibria may be found in time t < T
-Slightly slows down simulation, so is not recommended in larger instances when an equilibrium is not expected to be found

num_of_spins: Number of spins plotted in spin dynamics plot
-integer
-The selection of which spins will be plotted is randomized

movie: Parameter which designates if a movie (an image at each simulation timestep) is to be made characterizing the spins' evolution and the distribution of spin flips
-boolean
-Can be helpful to visualize the evolution of spins
-Takes additional storage and runtime (up by a factor of 2-4). Be wary of using it in more computationally expensive cases

time_ranges_list: List of time ranges over which avalanches will be separately extracted
-list of pairs of integers (e.g. [[0, 4], [4, 16], [16, 64], [64, 200]])
-Useful to establish the attractiveness of the LRO phase

fit: Fits ensemble-averaged avalanche distribution to a scale-free or Gaussian distribution
-'sf' for scale-free, 'g' for Gaussian, or anything else for no fit

fsscaling: Parameter which determines if a finite-size scaling analysis is to be performed on the avalanche distributions
-boolean


T: Total physical simulation time
-integer
-Must be increased as gamma (inverse dynamic memory timescale) is decreased

dt: Simulation timestep
-float
-Time after which dynamic spin and memory variables are updated during the simulation (via Euler method)
-0.25 is about the coarsest timestep I could use while still preserving the smoothness of spin evolution profiles. Be wary of using anything larger than this

transient: Transient duration
-integer or float
-Manual cutoff (in physical time) at which one dictates the transient is over, and spin/avalanche data can begin being collected
-Is on the order of gamma^-1 (e.g., for gamma = 0.1, I noticed the transient ended around 20)

plot_duration: Duration over which spin dynamics are plotted
-integer
-May be useful for this to be less than T for long instances or for high-frequency spin dynamics

time_window: Physical time after which spin flips (adjacent to recently flipped spins in an avalanche) are no longer considered to be part of that previous avalanche
-float
-E.g. A spin at [4, 5], part of a particular avalanche, flips at time t. If a spin at [3, 5], [5, 5], [4, 4], or [4, 6] flips before time t + time_window, we consider the more recent flip to be induced by the previous flip, and thus, it joins that avalanche. If this flip happens later, we consider it to be a new avalanche altogether
-time_window ~10-20 * dt gives LRO behavior for gamma \in [0.15, 0.40]
-This parameter will be need to be tuned based on gamma


alpha: Finite-size scaling analysis parameter
-float
-To be changed manually based on the quality of the previous scaling guess

beta: Finite-size scaling analysis parameter
-float
-To be changed manually based on the quality of the previous scaling guess
